[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/channingwalton/scala-contracts.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/channingwalton/scala-contracts)

This is an implementation of Simon Peyton-Jones's [Composing contracts: an adventure in financial engineering](http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/Papers/financial-contracts/contracts-icfp.htm) based on a [Haskell implemention](http://web.archive.org/web/20130326233424/http://contracts.scheming.org/) by Anton van Straaten.

At present, the code is a brutal transformation of Anton's work into Scala and in need of much refinement.

All thoughts, suggestions and contributions are most gratefully accepted. Particularly new models, and tests!
